        "-> Purpose of Conditional Statements in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in a program based on certain conditions. They allow the program to execute specific blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False. This makes the program more dynamic and enables different behaviors based on the data or state of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Decision Making:\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditional statements allow the program to choose between different options or actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "They enable branching logic, where different blocks of code are executed depending on conditions.\n",

        "2. Control Flow:\n",

        "They control the flow of execution, ensuring that only the relevant code is executed based on specific criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "This helps in creating more flexible and responsive programs.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Handling Different Scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "They help the program handle various scenarios or states and take appropriate actions. For example, responding to user inputs or adjusting program behavior based on time or data.\n",

        "4. Improving Readability and Efficiency:\n",

        "The simplest form of a conditional statement. It executes a block of code if the given condition is True.\n",
        "\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "\n",

        "Executes one block of code if the condition is True, and another block if the condition is False.\n",

If the condition in the if statement is not true, Python will check the condition in the elif statement. If the elif condition is true, the corresponding block of code will execute. If no if or elif condition is true, the else block (if provided) will execute.\n",
